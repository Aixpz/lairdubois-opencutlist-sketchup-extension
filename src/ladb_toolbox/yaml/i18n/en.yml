      You are running an older version of Sketchup ({{ sketchupVersion }}). This plugin will work, but may exhibit certain bugs.
      To take full advantage of this plugin, we recommend to upgrade to **Sketchup 2017**.

      Select the root of the cutlist in your scene then click on the **Generate** button.
      If the selection is empty, all visible components of the scene will be considered to compute the cutlist.

      auto_orient: Automatic orientation of parts
      auto_orient_help: |
        If this option is enabled, the 3 dimensions of a part are sorted such that the largest represents the *length* and the smallest represents the *thickness*.

        Otherwise, the local axes of the object define the dimensions as:
         - *length* on the <span style='color:red'>red</span> axis
         - *width* on the <span style='color:green'>green</span> axis
         - *thickness* on the <span style='color:blue'>blue</span> axis
      smart_material:  "*Intelligent* assignment of material"
      smart_material_help: If this option is enabled, parts without defined material may be assigned the material assigned to one of their parent or child.
      part_number_with_letters: Use letters to enumerate parts
      part_number_with_letters_help: If this option is enabled, parts are enumerated using letters (A, B, C, ... Z, AA, AB, ...).
      part_number_sequence_by_group: Reinitialize the enumeration of parts by block
      part_number_sequence_by_group_help: If this option is enabled, the enumeration of parts is reinitialized to 1 (or A) for each block (groups of parts with the same material thickness).
      hide_untyped_material_dimensions: Hide the dimensions for parts without type
      hide_untyped_material_dimensions_help: If this option is active, the dimensions of parts without defined material type (**Solid wood** or **Sheet good**) will not be displayed.
      hide_raw_dimensions: Hide raw dimensions
      hide_raw_dimensions_help: If this option is active, the raw dimensions of parts will not be displayed.
      hide_final_dimensions: Masquer les dimension finies
      hide_final_dimensions_help: Si cette option est active, les dimensions **finies** des pièces ne sont pas affichées.
      part_order_strategy: Sort order of parts
      part_order_strategy_help: |
        Define the sort order of parts by reorganizing the following lines.
        Each property can be sorted in <i class="ladb-toolbox-icon-sort-asc"></i> *ascending* or <i class="ladb-toolbox-icon-sort-desc"></i> *descending* order.

    warning:
      partial_cutlist: This cutlist is a partial representation of your model, as it merely uses a selection of parts.
      no_typed_materials_in_model: This model does not use any defined material (**Solid wood** or **Sheet good**).
      no_typed_materials_in_selection: The selection does not use any defined material (**Solid wood** or **Sheet good**).
    tip:
      no_component: |
        The parts to be included in the *cutlist* must instances of a **component**.
        If you use only groups, convert them into components.
        When using components parts can be replicated without being copied.
      no_typed_materials: Apply a material on the parts to be included in the cutlist and define the properties of this material (**Solid wood** or **Sheet good**) on the tab <i class="ladb-toolbox-icon-materials"></i> **Materials**.
