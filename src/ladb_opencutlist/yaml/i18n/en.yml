        hence, in the local coordinate system:
        - *length* is on the <span style='color:red'>red</span> axis

        With *Labels* you can add keywords to customize the part definitions.
        You can add as many labels as you see fit.
        The visible parts of your custlist can then be filtered according to the label list.

      axes_help: Arrange the dimensions so they match the axes colors of your part.
      axes_tip: |
        It must be noted that if the option *Automatic orientation of parts* is not active or if the part is *locked on its axes* then :
         - the **length** is read on the <strong style='color:red'>red</strong> axes,
         - the **width** is read on the <strong style='color:green'>green</strong> axes and
         - the **thickness** is read on the <strong style='color:blue'>blue</strong> axes.

        If this option is selected, the 3 dimensions of a part are sorted such that the largest represents the *length* and the smallest represents the *thickness*.

        If this option is left unselected, the local axes of the part define the dimensions as follows
